DISCLAIMER: I had to run my LLM twice. Once to get its opinion on the tweets regardig their sentiment, then again to have it explain why it disagreed with the human label.
I tried to do this with one large prompt, but the LLM kept getting data from the beyes prediction or the label and just saying whatever they said, not deciding for itself.

LLM's explanation of tweets it disagreed with the human label on:

For the tweet "truli later move know queen bee upward bound movingonup" categorized with 'negative sentiment', it seems like the words "truli later move" and "know queen bee" might imply a sense of disappointment or feeling stuck in a situation where progress feels unattainable. The phrase "upward bound movingonup" might be interpreted as a desire for progress or improvement, but the overall tone appears to be more on the negative side.

I do not agree with this sentiment. To me, "upward bound movingonup" has a hopeful and determined sentiment, which is positive. Also, "queen bee" is an empowering term in my opinion, which is positive as well.

The tweet "new report talk burn calories cold work harder warm feel better weather :p" is categorized with 'positive sentiment' probably because it mentions burning calories, working harder, and feeling better, which are typically associated with positive actions or outcomes. The emoticon ":p" at the end might indicate a playful or lighthearted tone, further reinforcing the positivity.

I agree completely with the LLM's rationale.

As for "harri niall 94 harri born ik stupid wanna chang :d" being labeled with 'negative sentiment', phrases like "ik stupid" and "wanna change :d" suggest feelings of frustration, self-criticism, or a desire for something to be different. The overall sentiment of the tweet appears to lean towards the negative side.

I agree completely with the LLM's rationale.

In the tweet "park get sunlight" categorized as 'positive sentiment', the mention of getting sunlight is often associated with positivity and rejuvenation. Spending time outdoors in the sun is typically seen as a mood-booster and beneficial for one's well-being, hence the positive sentiment tag.

I agree completely with the LLM's rationale.

In the tweet "uff itna miss karhi thi ap :p" labeled with 'negative sentiment', the use of "miss" indicates longing or a sense of loss, which is commonly linked to negative emotions. The emoticon ":p" at the end might suggest an attempt to lighten the mood, but the overall sentiment still comes across as negative.

This tweet is hard to discern becuase the subject matter of missing something is negative, but the :p emoji might hint that it's not really 'missing' something, but more so 
appriciating the past.

For the tweet "u prob fun david" categorized as 'positive sentiment', the message appears to be straightforward and complimentary, suggesting that the person being addressed is probably fun. This positive and affirming tone is likely why it's categorized as such.

I agree with the LLM, unless the tweet is sarcastic, which it sounds like it might be. However, we have no way to know, so I think the LLM is right.

Lastly, the tweet "beloved grandmother" marked with 'positive sentiment' is likely categorized as such because the term "beloved" conveys warmth, affection, and a strong emotional connection. The mention of a grandmother also adds a sentimental and positive connotation to the tweet.

I agree with the LLM.


My attempt to fool the LLM: "People who are so happy they are always smiling and talking about how fun and beautiful their lives are are the worst"

Bayes prediction: 4.147673896261676

LLM response:
Negative sentiment.

The tweet expresses a negative sentiment by saying that people who are overly happy and constantly talking about it are "the worst." This statement implies a sense of annoyance or disdain towards individuals who exude a consistently positive demeanor. The use of the word "worst" suggests a strong negative sentiment towards these people, indicating a lack of appreciation for their behavior.
